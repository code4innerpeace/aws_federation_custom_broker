# AWS Custom Identity Broker Access to AWS Console.

This code creates AWS signin url that enables Federated Users to access the AWS Management Console.
This code is based on current code at 'https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html',
but current code doesn't work for Python3. So modified the code to make it work for Python3.

# Requirements :-
1) Python3
